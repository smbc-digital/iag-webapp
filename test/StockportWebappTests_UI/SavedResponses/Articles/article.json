Hannah is just two years old and has attended Stockport Village Nursery in the town centre since September 2013, taking her 15 free hours 9am till 12pm, Monday to Friday.\n\n\"I found out about the free 15 hours for two year olds from the Job Centre and after receiving a letter from the Council.  My other children are much older and I didn’t have the opportunity for free child care with them. I used to work as a teaching assistant but since Hannah was born I have been a stay at home mum.\n\n{{Alerts-Inline:A6 Closure}}\n\nI wasn’t sure at first, but I called the Council to check I was eligible and got a form from my local Sure Start Children’s Centre.  It was simple enough to fill in and I got a letter back telling me that Hannah was eligible for up to 15 free hours a week.\n\nI was a bit nervous at first as Hannah was only two and I worried that she might be too young to start in a ‘school’ environment, but that hasn’t been the case at all.  As soon as we visited the nursery I could see that this place could give Hannah what I couldn’t always give her at home.\n\nThe activities such as messy play with paints, bikes and play equipment outside – they even built an igloo at Christmas with an ice lake and penguins!  Just as importantly she gets to mix with other children of her own age, who share her imagination and who she can learn from.\n\n{{CAROUSEL:![UITEST:Image 1](//images.contentful.com/6cfgzlmcakf7/2FNKi2ZYcomigKGAqWiSyC/aec4f120903972fd6c842e84603c6a50/Flu_Jab.jpg), ![UITEST:Image 2](//images.contentful.com/6cfgzlmcakf7/3TsbpFmDewU4iuEAQU4IAo/afb6c155b46b9a0f196409ebb47cd4ff/Cllr_Foster_and_the_children_from_RECLAIM.jpg), ![UITEST:Image 3](//images.contentful.com/6cfgzlmcakf7/5NxhtngXYcEUUa6uOy6Ym6/a9263e313e538c45d04ce9a813880a2d/Art_gallery_image_2.jpg)}}\n\nWhen she started Hannah was very shy but in less than a year she’s grown so much in confidence. Her speech has really developed and she plays quite happily alongside other children. \n\nI have been surprised at how much she has learnt through just ‘playing’.  She’ll come home and hang her own coat up, wash her hands and sit at the table to eat her dinner – being at the nursery has really helped prepare her for our daily routines.\n\nFrom my perspective those few hours every morning have allowed me to get on top of the housework and spend some precious time with my older children.  I’m even planning to start looking for work now I know Hannah is settled and happy.\n\nIt can be a scary thought sending your two year old to nursery but it has been a really rewarding experience for Hannah and myself. I would urge any parent who thinks that they might be eligible to find out more.\"\n\n\n{{CAROUSEL:![UITEST:Image 1](//images.contentful.com/6cfgzlmcakf7/2FNKi2ZYcomigKGAqWiSyC/aec4f120903972fd6c842e84603c6a50/Flu_Jab.jpg), ![UITEST:Image 2](//images.contentful.com/6cfgzlmcakf7/3TsbpFmDewU4iuEAQU4IAo/afb6c155b46b9a0f196409ebb47cd4ff/Cllr_Foster_and_the_children_from_RECLAIM.jpg), ![UITEST:Image 3](//images.contentful.com/6cfgzlmcakf7/5NxhtngXYcEUUa6uOy6Ym6/a9263e313e538c45d04ce9a813880a2d/Art_gallery_image_2.jpg)}}\n### VIDEO:\n{{VIDEO:G3HqZ}}\n\n<iframe width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lOMjIT1sAhE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n{{CAROUSEL:![Image 3](//images.contentful.com/6cfgzlmcakf7/5NxhtngXYcEUUa6uOy6Ym6/a9263e313e538c45d04ce9a813880a2d/Art_gallery_image_2.jpg), ![Image 1](//images.contentful.com/6cfgzlmcakf7/2FNKi2ZYcomigKGAqWiSyC/aec4f120903972fd6c842e84603c6a50/Flu_Jab.jpg), ![Image 2](//images.contentful.com/6cfgzlmcakf7/3TsbpFmDewU4iuEAQU4IAo/afb6c155b46b9a0f196409ebb47cd4ff/Cllr_Foster_and_the_children_from_RECLAIM.jpg),![Hong Kong at night](//images.contentful.com/6cfgzlmcakf7/1UsN59Cdbae60QACKEYOgI/73a0d4876a1cb2f6d51166281447c9cb/shutterstock_112151279.jpg)}}",
