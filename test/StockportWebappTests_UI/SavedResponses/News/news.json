With restaurants, including Zizzi and Pizza Express, cafes, cinema, shops and car parking, thousands of new visitors will come to Stockport each year to enjoy everything on offer at Redrock and across the rest of the town centre.\n\nRedrock is part of a £1 billion transformation taking place across Stockport at the moment.   Developments are on site, transport links are being improved; homes are being built; new businesses are opening and opportunities are being created for everyone.  Investing in Stockport is changing the town, making it even stronger and more successful.\n\nCouncillor Kate Butler, Executive Member for Economy and Regeneration at Stockport Council said “It is great to see the frames starting to go up at Redrock, and how the work is beginning to take shape.  I am really excited about everything taking place across our town centre at the moment and how the town is changing.\n\n“From the investments being made around the Market Place, to the improved links that are being created between areas of the town centre and our new developments, it is fantastic to see how work is coming together and the transformation taking place.”\n\nAs work at Redrock and across the town centre continues, all of our shops and businesses are still open for everyone to visit and enjoy.  The Council and its partners are also committed to working with local businesses helping to ensure the town centre continues to thrive during the construction works as well as once works are completed.\n\nTo find out more about Redrock Stockport and the work taking place across the town please visit our [webpages](http://www.stockport.gov.uk/services/communitypeopleliving/newapproach/investingingrowth/).\n\n{{PDF:Stockport-Metroshuttle.pdf}}\n{{PDF:Stockport-Metroshuttle.pdf}}\n\n{{CAROUSEL:![UITEST:Image 1](//images.contentful.com/6cfgzlmcakf7/2FNKi2ZYcomigKGAqWiSyC/aec4f120903972fd6c842e84603c6a50/Flu_Jab.jpg), ![UITEST:Image 2](//images.contentful.com/6cfgzlmcakf7/3TsbpFmDewU4iuEAQU4IAo/afb6c155b46b9a0f196409ebb47cd4ff/Cllr_Foster_and_the_children_from_RECLAIM.jpg), ![UITEST:Image 3](//images.contentful.com/6cfgzlmcakf7/5NxhtngXYcEUUa6uOy6Ym6/a9263e313e538c45d04ce9a813880a2d/Art_gallery_image_2.jpg)}}\n\n{{VIDEO:kQl5D}}\n\nThis is some text\n\n{{PROFILE:sarahs-story}}\n\n\nand there should be a profile above this",

Within Stockport specifically, we have seen a dramatic drop in reports of antisocial behaviour and violent crime cases.\n\n“Whilst our work with partner agencies for our Safe4Summer campaign will be delivering activities for young people, we are appealing to parents and guardians to take an active interest in where their children are and what they are doing.\n\n“We’d also like the wider community to be proactive in reporting any instances of antisocial behaviour to police on 101 or via the new LiveChat function on the GMP website.”\n\nCllr Sheila Bailey, Cabinet Member for Communities and Housing at Stockport Council, said: “Summer holidays have started and it’s the time where young people go out more and explore, so we’re asking them to be careful and to have respect for others around them. \n\n“We’re also asking everyone to take a bit more care with outdoor fires. Fires often begin by simply not properly putting out a cigarette, leaving a barbecue unattended or even leaving a glass bottle in the sun on dry grass.
