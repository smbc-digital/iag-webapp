        "body": "Over the past few days, cranes have begun lifting sections of the frame for the new 10 screen The Light Cinema into place, as work with Wates Construction on the new £45 million Redrock Stockport presses ahead.\n\nOpening its doors later next year, Redrock is transforming the area of Stockport town centre behind Prince’s Street into a new £45 million leisure destination.  With restaurants, including Zizzi and Pizza Express, cafes, cinema, shops and car parking, thousands of new visitors will come to Stockport each year to enjoy everything on offer at Redrock and across the rest of the town centre.\n\nRedrock is part of a £1 billion transformation taking place across Stockport at the moment.   Developments are on site, transport links are being improved; homes are being built; new businesses are opening and opportunities are being created for everyone.  Investing in Stockport is changing the town, making it even stronger and more successful.\n\nCouncillor Kate Butler, Executive Member for Economy and Regeneration at Stockport Council said “It is great to see the frames starting to go up at Redrock, and how the work is beginning to take shape.  I am really excited about everything taking place across our town centre at the moment and how the town is changing.\n\n“From the investments being made around the Market Place, to the improved links that are being created between areas of the town centre and our new developments, it is fantastic to see how work is coming together and the transformation taking place.”\n\nAs work at Redrock and across the town centre continues, all of our shops and businesses are still open for everyone to visit and enjoy.  The Council and its partners are also committed to working with local businesses helping to ensure the town centre continues to thrive during the construction works as well as once works are completed.\n\nTo find out more about Redrock Stockport and the work taking place across the town please visit our [webpages](http://www.stockport.gov.uk/services/communitypeopleliving/newapproach/investingingrowth/).\n\n{{PDF:Stockport-Metroshuttle.pdf}}\n{{PDF:Stockport-Metroshuttle.pdf}}\n\n{{CAROUSEL:![UITEST:Image 1](//images.contentful.com/6cfgzlmcakf7/2FNKi2ZYcomigKGAqWiSyC/aec4f120903972fd6c842e84603c6a50/Flu_Jab.jpg), ![UITEST:Image 2](//images.contentful.com/6cfgzlmcakf7/3TsbpFmDewU4iuEAQU4IAo/afb6c155b46b9a0f196409ebb47cd4ff/Cllr_Foster_and_the_children_from_RECLAIM.jpg), ![UITEST:Image 3](//images.contentful.com/6cfgzlmcakf7/5NxhtngXYcEUUa6uOy6Ym6/a9263e313e538c45d04ce9a813880a2d/Art_gallery_image_2.jpg)}}\n\n{{VIDEO:kQl5D}}\n\nThis is some text\n\n{{PROFILE:sarahs-story}}\n\n\nand there should be a profile above this",
